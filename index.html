         What is Music?
            <br>
            <br>
           Music is the art or science of combing vocal or instrumental sounds (sometimes both) to produce beauty of form,harmony and expression of motion. As a teenager, I listen to music everyday.Listening to music takes the stress away from my mind. I love listening to music.  Listening to music is my new hobby. Music comes in different genres.I listen to many genres. I listen music when i am bored or anytime I just like. I dont have a genre I listen the song i like that makes me feel good,happy. If you dont listen to music you should try it will make you feel so good â˜º.
